# Handwashing Stage Classification Using CNNs

This project uses a deep convolutional neural network to classify the 8 WHO-recommended handwashing steps for COVID-19 compliance monitoring in healthcare settings.

## 📌 Project Summary
- Trained a CNN from scratch and also experimented with MobileNetV2 for transfer learning.
- Dataset consisted of 8 handwashing stages, contributed by multiple users.
- Applied image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model evaluation techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- Custom CNN architecture for image classification
- Error handling and label validation for image dataset
- Training/Validation accuracy and loss visualization
- Evaluation on test set with annotated results

## 📁 Dataset
